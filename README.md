These are my completed assignments from the data science skills bootcamp that I completed June 2023. The majority of the tasks were in Python and some later tasks are in Jupyter Notebook. Some tasks require data files in the form of either .txt or .csv. These data files are included in the folders so that the programmes can execute.
