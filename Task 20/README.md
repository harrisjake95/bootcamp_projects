* Store 2 garden path sentences in a list

* Add the following sentences to your list:

Mary gave the child a Band-Aid.

That Jill is never here hurts.

The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi.

* Tokenise each sentence in the list and perform named entity recognition

* Examine how spaCy has categorised each sentence. Then, use spacy.explain to look up and print the meaning of entities that you donâ€™t understand. For example: print(spacy.explain("FAC"))
