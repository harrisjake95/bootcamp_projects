# Defining Functions

* Your task will be to calculate a userâ€™s holiday cost including the plane cost, hotel cost, and car rental cost.

* First, get the following user inputs:

1. city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (You can create some options for them. Remember: Each city will have different flight costs.)

2. num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel

3. rental_days: The number of days that they will be hiring a car for.

* Next, create the following four functions:

1. hotel_cost: This function will take the num_nights as an argument, and return a total cost for the hotel stay (You can choose the price per night charged at the hotel).

2. plane_cost:Thisfunctionwilltakethecity_flightasanargument and return a cost for the flight (hint: use if/else if statements in the function to retrieve a price based on the chosen city).

3. car_rental:Thisfunctionwilltaketherental_daysasanargument and return the total cost of the car rental (you can choose the daily rental cost.)

4. holiday_cost: This function will take the three arguments hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. Using these three arguments, you can call all three of the above functions with respective arguments and finally return a total cost for your holiday.
