# Lists and Dictionaries

* Create a list called menu, which should contain at least 4 items in the cafe.
  
* Next, create a dictionary called stock, which should contain the stock
value for each item on your menu.

* Create another dictionary called price, which should contain the prices for
each item on your menu.

* Next, calculate the total_stock worth in the cafe. You will need to
remember to loop through the appropriate dictionaries and lists to do this.
